        <h1>Project Idea</h1>
        <p>I plan to create a game by culminating aspects from all my favorite games that I spend majority of my free time playing. This game would be in a hide and seek format with the seeker being in a first person POV with the hiders being that of a third person POV, the hiders will run around the map gathering “items” or “powerups” to give them an opportunity to stand a chance against the seeker who will inherently be designed to be more powerful than the hiders, in order to give a sense of fear and care to the actions of the hiders.</p>
        <p>I grew up playing games as a main pastime any chance I could, as years went on and I gained more and more experience in what games are and what they can provide, from both technological wonder and atmospheric immersion, I wondered more and more of the self-gratification and enjoyment that would come of creating or participating in the creation of one myself, I find the thought of being able to share and be inside of a game world created by me to extremely exciting and captivating.</p>
        <p>In my game, you would see a group of players (between 2 and 5) being pitted against one another in a 1v5 hide and seek scenario set in a simple and large block shaped apartment complex with rooms and distractions of various shapes and sizes, the hiders will have a goal of surviving a certain period of time, which would scale to greater lengths the more hiders there are in the game, all while the seeker progressively becomes stronger and more oppressive, applying more fear and pressure to the hiders. The goal of the seeker is to catch up to and capture the hiders, using his arsenal of abilities to create advantageous situations to catch the hiders off guard, these abilities unlock progressively throughout the course of hunting the hiders. The seeker is akin to a well-practiced predator having heightened senses assisting in finding his prey, his keen sense of smell has enabled him to occasionally detect if players are close by although the range and cooldown of this is rather limiting, his keen hearing allows him to hear the sounds of footsteps much easier than that of the hiders, and his sheer strength allows him to break down certain walls and structures with his bare hands. The hiders also have abilities to assist them in their evasion of the seeker, although the hiders abilities work different, they are instead found as items throughout the level which are consumed upon use, they have the ability to find a hessian bag, which upon getting close enough to the seeker they are able to place it upon his head, temporarily blinding him so the hider can then make their escape and find a new place to hide, they may also find a cup of coffee which would temporarily give them a burst of speed again assisting in quick escape from the seeker, if they find a baseball bat they gain the ability to break down walls and objects to create paths to escape or spots to hide, this ability is not consumable like the other abilities and instead gives them the use all round long, although it may not always be in the hiders best interest as it creates loud noise which may lead the seeker towards them, the hiders also have the ability to pick up and move certain objects in order to assist in hiding by for example moving boxes to jump on in order to gain access to higher areas, or moving objects to arouse suspicion to an area they don’t plan on being located in. The game will have a persistent slight fog to it in order to assist in the hiders blending into the environment, if the seeker eventually reaches the hider and maintains close contact for 2 seconds, the hider will die, and then be put into a state where they can spectate their fellow hiders and await the ending of the round.</p>
        <p>In order to achieve this project, I will need to download the relevant game development software and educate myself on how the software works, and its limitations in order to attempt to fully implement the features I have outlined, I believe YouTube will be a very good asset in achieving this as there are a LOT of tutorials to assist in game development for people with little to no experience, majority of the software used in popular development is also free of charge making it very easy to get into.</p>
        <p>I may have bit or more than I can chew with this my optimism and excitement for this project its highly possible I’m unable to learn the relevant skills needed to achieve everything I want for this due to my limited experience with game development software and coding as a whole, but If all goes to plan I will at the least have managed to get a start on gathering some of the skills required to pull this project together which will put me many steps closer to my ideal job, by creating foundations and proving to myself that I have the determination and ethic required to get to where I want to be, I will also have created a fun party game in which I can use to engage with my friends and family.</p>
